  * @brief   This file provides a set of functions needed to manage the I2C LM75 
  *          temperature sensor mounted on STM32373C-EVAL board . 
  *          It implements a high level communication layer for read and write 
  *          from/to this sensor. The needed STM323F37x hardware resources (I2C and 
  *          GPIO) are defined in stm32373c_eval.h file, and the initialization is 
  *          performed in TSENSOR_IO_Init() function declared in stm32373c_eval.c 
  *          file.
  *          You can easily tailor this driver to any other development board, 
  *          by just adapting the defines for hardware resources and 
  *          TSENSOR_IO_Init() function.
